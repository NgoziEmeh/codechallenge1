Calculating Averages and Modes

John and Mark both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points while Mark's team scored 116, 94, and 123 points.

1. Calculate the average scores of each team.

2. Decide which team wins in average (highest average score) and print the winner to the console. Also, include the average scores in the output.

3. Change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account, the fact that the two teams can draw. i.e They may have same average.
