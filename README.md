Calculating Averages and Modes (My solution is included)

John and Mark both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points while Mark's team scored 116, 94, and 123 points.

1. Calculate the average scores of each team.

2. Decide which team wins in average (highest average score) and print the winner to the console. Also, include the average scores in the output.

3. Change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account, the fact that the two teams can draw. i.e They may have same average.

4. Another of their friend, Mary, also plays basketball. Her team participated and scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Add Mary's team scores to your calculator and get the overall average.

5. Decide the overall winner based on highest calculated average.
